# Searching-Items-in-Websites

I created this query to check my products on the website of a wholeseller where is "https://www.merterfashioncenter.com/"

First, download the cromedriver that suits to your chorome version from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Secondly, download the "stock_kontrol.xlsx" from my directory then change the location of the excel document in the codes.

Maybe some codes has to be changed to work corretly because of the website have been updated in the past.
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE SOME DATA LOCATIONS ON THE QUERY LIKE "ELEMENTS".




Plese don't hesitate to contact me.
